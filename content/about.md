My name is Zack. I've recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a masters degree in applied statistics. Generally speaking - I'm interested in all things data science/statistics - but would really like to expand in the realm of data visualization. For examples of some work I've done, you can see below:

* [Shiny App for Introductory Statistics: Confidence Intervals and Confidence Levels](http://shiny.stat.lsa.umich.edu/users/zkeller/conf_ints/)
* [Shiny App for Introductory Statistics: Visualizing Probabilities and P-values](http://shiny.stat.lsa.umich.edu/pvals/)
* [An Analysis of Measles in CA](/../stats531_zkeller_final_project.html)
* [An Analysis of San Francisco Crime](/../Project Write-Up.pdf) (Group Project)
* [R Package for Reduced Rank Ridge Regression - Stats Computing Final Project](https://github.com/zkeller89/RRRR615) (Group Project, based on paper by [Mukherjee and Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/pubs/Mukherjee-SADM11.pdf))

Outside of stats and data analysis, I enjoy playing soccer, exercising, listening to music, and other nice things. 

I am currently looking for opportunities in the realm of data analysis and statistics, so if you have anything in mind, do feel free to drop me a line. My email is zkeller[at]umich.edu. My resume is available [here](/../zkeller_resume.pdf).
